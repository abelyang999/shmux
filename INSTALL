-- shmux NEWS

Version 0.9a introduced the following usage changes:

o The old -q option is now -Q
o Old behaviour of -o option can be obtained with -qqo

-- shmux dependencies

shmux will make use of the following programs if they are available on the
system (and found in the PATH).  They are not required but allow using
certain optional features of shmux.  See the man page for details.

+ fping: http://www.fping.com/
+ ssh: http://www.fressh.org/, http://www.openssh.org/, ...

Also, if you want Perl Compatible Regular Expression support, you'll need
the PCRE library:

+ pcre: http://www.pcre.org/

Although this package uses autoconf, there is no real attempt to make sure
it works on older UNIX systems as it relies on a number of somewhat modern
system calls.
