-- shmux status

This is the first public release of shmux, so you should be prepared for
the unexpected as things have not yet been polished as much as they need to
be.  A number of features are also missing and will be added in future
releases.  What is documented (in the manual page) is implemented and
should be working, but the behaviour may slightly change.

-- shmux dependencies

shmux will make use of the following programs if they are available on the
system (and found in the PATH).  They are not required but allow using
certain optional features of shmux.  See the man page for details.

+ fping: http://www.fping.com/
+ ssh: http://www.fressh.org/, http://www.openssh.org/, ...

-- shmux installation notes

(1) ./configure
(2) make
(3) make test
(4) make install

-- shmux contact

Send bug reports to `shmux-bugs@taranis.org'.  A bug report is an adequate
description of the environment (versions of this package, the OS, fping and
ssh) and of the problem: your input, what you expected, what you got, and
why you believe it to be wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only describe
a solution, from which the problem might be difficult to infer.

Your feedback will help to make a better and more portable package.
Consider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If you
develop anything pertaining to `shmux' or have suggestions, share your
findings by writing to `shmux@taranis.org'.
