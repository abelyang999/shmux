Changes since 0.4a [2002/08/21]:

- Fixed the sometimes erroneous "Pending" count in status display.
- -o options now generates more files per target.
- final summary report is now more detailed (in part thanks to -e).
- added -e and -E options.
- IRIX hides basename() in libgen, look there just in case.
- termcap/curses checks and logic cleaned up in configure.ac & term.c.
- MAXNAMLEN replaced with PATH_MAX.

- improved handling of partial lines.
- truncated lines would cause a crash (failed assertion) with -o.
- added -m option.
- enabled gcc macros for v3.x
- fixed miscellaneous little bugs in exec().
- fixed getopt() usage.

Changes since 0.2a [2002/07/08]:

- SIGINT is now caught, but not by children (which will die right away).
- create the directory supplied with the -o option if it doesn't exist.

- added environment variables SHMUX_*SH.
- cleaned up loop.c for better readability, also fixed output processing bugs.
