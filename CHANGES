Changes since 0.8a [2003/04/30]:

- fixed -t option behaviour.
- tty_restore() must do its work only for shmux, not forked processes.
- reset signal handlers in exec().
- Added new -q option.
- Renamed -q option to -Q.

Changes since 0.7a [2003/03/30]:

- fixed parsing of ranges so that "x-" actually works.
- added -S option.
- added minimal interactivity.
- cleaned up window width tracking.
- fixed unlikely (so far) bug in target_results().

Changes since 0.6a [2003/03/23]:

- reading the list of targets from the standard input is now supported.
- added missing variable initialization.
- fixed installation of mcmd.sh.
- renamed some functions to avoid names clashes (FreeBSD 4.7).
- simplified term.c system inclusions (RedHat 7.3 has broken includes).

Changes since 0.5a [2003/01/05]:

- added mcmd.sh sample script.
- fixed potential crash in target_results() when interrupted.
- status progress is now truncated to the window width.
- aggressively try to find a tty to display progress status.
- terminal initialization logic is now more flexible.
- added -a and -A options.
- fixed (very rare) file descriptor leak.
- minor fix in algorithm spawning new children should speed things up a bit.
- "exit" files were created for -m rather than -o.
- added a workaround for Linux's pathetic implementation of strtok().

Changes since 0.4a [2002/08/21]:

- fixed the sometimes erroneous "Pending" count in status display.
- -o options now generates more files per target.
- final summary report is now more detailed (in part thanks to -e).
- added -e and -E options.
- IRIX hides basename() in libgen, look there just in case.
- termcap/curses checks and logic cleaned up in configure.ac & term.c.
- MAXNAMLEN replaced with PATH_MAX.

Changes since 0.3a [2002/07/11]:

- improved handling of partial lines.
- truncated lines would cause a crash (failed assertion) with -o.
- added -m option.
- enabled gcc macros for v3.x
- fixed miscellaneous little bugs in exec().
- fixed getopt() usage.

Changes since 0.2a [2002/07/08]:

- SIGINT is now caught, but not by children (which will die right away).
- create the directory supplied with the -o option if it doesn't exist.
- cleaned up environment manipulation in exec().
- -b negates old -v option which is now the default, -v replaces old -d.
- added environment variables SHMUX_SSH*_OPTS.
- added -xa options to ssh by default.
- SHMUX_SH was overloaded, added SHMUX_RCMD, renamed -m option to -r.
- use strsignal(2) instead of sys_signame[].

Changes since 0.1a [2002/07/04]:

- added -o option.
- don't display the status line unless stdout is a tty, even without -s.
- added kludge to work around NetBSD's broken poll(2) implementation.
- adjusted formula deciding the maximum allowed for -M.
- added -C option.
- algorithm now prefers starting real commands over test commands.
- made it easier to understand why tests fail (see -t).
- added environment variables SHMUX_*SH.
- cleaned up loop.c for better readability, also fixed output processing bugs.
- updated status line format and added load average to it (where supported).
- -m didn't actually do anything, even if most of the code was written for it.
- status line was wrong when fping wasn't used.
