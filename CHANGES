Changes since 0.1a:

- added -o option.
- don't display the status line unless stdout is a tty, even without -s.
- added kludge to work around NetBSD's broken poll(2) implementation.
- adjusted formula deciding the maximum allowed for -M.
- children are now properly polled for data.
- added -C option.
- algorithm now prefers starting real commands over test commands.
- made it easier to understand why tests fail (see -t).
- added environment variables SHMUX_*SH.
- cleaned up loop.c for better readability, also fixed output processing bugs.
- updated status line format and added load average to it (where supported).
- -m didn't actually do anything, even if most of the code was written for it.
- status line was wrong when fping wasn't used.
