- improved handling of partial lines.
- truncated lines would cause a crash (failed assertion) with -o.
- added -m option.
- enabled gcc macros for v3.x
- fixed miscellaneous little bugs in exec().
- fixed getopt() usage.

Changes since 0.2a [2002/07/08]:

- SIGINT is now caught, but not by children (which will die right away).
- create the directory supplied with the -o option if it doesn't exist.
- cleaned up environment manipulation in exec().
- -b negates old -v option which is now the default, -v replaces old -d.
- added environment variables SHMUX_SSH*_OPTS.
- added -xa options to ssh by default.
- SHMUX_SH was overloaded, added SHMUX_RCMD, renamed -m option to -r.
- use strsignal(2) instead of sys_signame[].

Changes since 0.1a [2002/07/04]:

- added -o option.
- don't display the status line unless stdout is a tty, even without -s.
- added kludge to work around NetBSD's broken poll(2) implementation.
- adjusted formula deciding the maximum allowed for -M.
- added -C option.
- algorithm now prefers starting real commands over test commands.
- made it easier to understand why tests fail (see -t).
- added environment variables SHMUX_*SH.
- cleaned up loop.c for better readability, also fixed output processing bugs.
- updated status line format and added load average to it (where supported).
- -m didn't actually do anything, even if most of the code was written for it.
- status line was wrong when fping wasn't used.
